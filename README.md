# my-react-starter
webpack react starter refer to Vue webpack

* webpack3
* Mobx 3
* react-router 4
* stylus | scss | sass support
* hot reload

> hot realod with `react-router` + `mobx` can not be implemented by configuration. in this project, we abandon to keep `current store` after hot reload. but the update to store(both value and action) can work.
